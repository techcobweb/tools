# tools
Tools and ad-hoc scripts I find useful.

- nexus-in-docker - start and stop nexus running on the local machine within a docker container
- galasa-in-docker - start and stop galasa in a collection of docker containers
- galasactl-update - pulls the latest galasactl binary for my mac into my path so I can use it
